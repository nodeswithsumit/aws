# Deploying a Simple Web Application

## Deploying on EC2 Instance

1. **Launch EC2 Instance**:
   - Launch an EC2 instance with the desired operating system (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu).

2. **Connect to EC2 Instance**:
   - Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.

3. **Install Web Server**:
   - Install the necessary web server software such as Apache HTTP Server or Nginx.

4. **Upload Web Application Files**:
   - Upload your web application files to the EC2 instance using SCP or SFTP.

5. **Configure Web Server**:
   - Configure the web server to serve the uploaded files.

6. **Open Ports**:
   - Open the necessary ports in the security group to allow inbound traffic to the web server (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).

7. **Optional: Configure Domain Name**:
   - Optionally, configure a domain name using Route 53 or a third-party domain registrar, and point it to the public IP address of your EC2 instance.

## Deploying on S3 Bucket

1. **Create S3 Bucket**:
   - Create an S3 bucket with a unique name.

2. **Upload Files**:
   - Upload your web application files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to the S3 bucket.

3. **Configure S3 Bucket**:
   - Configure the S3 bucket for static website hosting:
     - Enable static website hosting in the bucket properties.
     - Specify the index document (e.g., index.html) and error document if necessary.
     - Optionally, configure bucket policies to control access to the website content.

4. **Obtain Bucket URL**:
   - Obtain the bucket URL provided by Amazon S3 for accessing the website.

## Key Differences and Considerations

- **Cost**:
  - EC2 instance hosting may incur higher costs compared to using an S3 bucket, especially for low-traffic websites.

- **Scalability**:
  - EC2 instances require manual scaling and management, whereas S3 provides automatic scaling and high availability for static websites.

- **Maintenance**:
  - EC2 instances require regular maintenance and patching, while S3 hosting is fully managed by AWS.

- **Performance**:
  - S3 hosting may provide faster performance and lower latency for global audiences due to AWS's global infrastructure and CDN integration.

- **Complexity**:
  - Setting up and managing an EC2 instance requires more configuration and administration compared to using S3 bucket hosting, which is simpler and more straightforward.

Depending on your specific requirements, budget, and technical expertise, you can choose between deploying your web application on an EC2 instance or an S3 bucket. For simple static websites or single-page applications, S3 bucket hosting is often a cost-effective and efficient solution, while EC2 instances offer more flexibility and customization options for complex web applications.
